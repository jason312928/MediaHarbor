# Changelog

All notable changes to YouTube 4K Downloader will be documented in this file.

## [19.0.1] - 2026-06-03

### ⚡ Performance & Compatibility
- **Native Apple Silicon Support**: Detects CPU architecture during build and downloads native `arm64` FFmpeg/FFprobe binaries (or `amd64` for Intel Macs). This prevents Rosetta emulation requirement on Apple Silicon Macs.
- **Source Cleanup**: Removed leftover git conflict markers from the Python main script.

## [19.0.0] - 2026-01-30

### 🎨 Complete UI Redesign

A ground-up redesign following professional interface design principles for a cleaner, more polished experience.

**Visual Design**
- Single cyan accent color (#22d3ee) for focused visual hierarchy
- Borders-only depth strategy (no shadows) for a clean, modern look
- 8px spacing system throughout for consistent rhythm
- Four-level text hierarchy (primary/secondary/tertiary/muted)
- SF Pro Display and SF Mono fonts for professional typography

**Responsive Layout**
- Thumbnail dynamically scales with window size (200px to 480px)
- Title text wraps intelligently based on available space
- Quality cards in organized 3-column grid
- Efficient use of space on both small and large screens

**Streamlined Controls**
- Download button moved inline with quality header (saves vertical space)
- Trim controls moved from Settings to main screen for per-video trimming
- Collapsible trim inputs appear only when needed

### 🔧 Reliability Improvements

**Increased Timeouts**
- Analysis timeout increased from 30s to 90s (helps with slow connections and rate limiting)
- Playlist timeout increased from 60s to 120s (supports larger playlists)
- Better error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps

**Per-Video Trimming**
- Trim checkbox on main screen (no need to go to Settings)
- Start/End time fields appear when trim is enabled
- Settings automatically reset when analyzing a new video
- Supports MM:SS and HH:MM:SS formats

### Removed
- Trim tab removed from Settings (now on main screen)

**Technical Improvements**

- Firefox profile directory detection (handles random prefixes like `ef91sfop.yt-burner`)

v18.1.4 Changes - YOUTUBE 403 FIX (January 2026):

🚨 CRITICAL 403 FORBIDDEN FIX:
- YouTube has blocked the android_sdkless client causing widespread 403 errors
- Added --extractor-args "youtube:player_client=default,-android_sdkless"
- This excludes the blocked client while using yt-dlp's default selection
- Requires latest yt-dlp nightly for best results

 YT-DLP NIGHTLY SUPPORT:
- Added option to update to yt-dlp nightly builds (Settings → Updates)
- Nightly builds contain the latest YouTube workarounds
- Recommended when stable version stops working

🔄 IMPROVED RETRY LOGIC:
- Increased retry delays (10s, 20s, 30s, 45s, 60s) for YouTube rate limiting
- Total 6 attempts with progressive backoff
- Added --no-continue flag to restart failed downloads cleanly
- Better detection of recoverable vs permanent failures

 BETTER ERROR MESSAGES:
- Clearer explanation when videos fail due to YouTube restrictions
- Suggests updating yt-dlp when 403 errors occur
- Links to troubleshooting help

v18.1.3 Changes - MAJOR RELIABILITY UPDATE:

🔄 UNIFIED RETRY SYSTEM:
- All downloads now use a unified retry system with 6 total attempts
- Progressive delays between retries: 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s
- Silent retries for first 2 attempts - only logs if problem persists
- Applies to: main downloads, chapter downloads, playlist downloads
- Shows "Waiting Xs for YouTube..." during retry delays
- Much better handling of YouTube's aggressive rate limiting

🎬 TRUE 4K DOWNLOADS:
- FIXED: 4K downloads were actually downloading 1080p and upscaling (fake 4K!)
- Now correctly prioritizes RESOLUTION over codec for 4K+ content
- YouTube only offers H.264 up to 1080p; 4K requires VP9/AV1
- For 1080p and below, still prefers H.264 for hardware decoding benefits
- Resolution is now verified after download to ensure quality

🔧 403 FORBIDDEN FIXES:
- Removed forced player_client settings that YouTube was blocking
- Lets yt-dlp use its default player client selection (more reliable)
- Better detection of incomplete downloads (.part files)
- No longer falsely reports success when download is incomplete

Š BETTER PROGRESS FEEDBACK:
- Chapter encoding now shows FPS, Speed, and ETA during conversion
- Progress bar updates during retry waits so app doesn't appear frozen
- Cleaner activity log - removed alarming ERROR messages during normal retries
- Filtered confusing yt-dlp warnings (ffmpeg installation, DASH m4a, etc.)

🍎 MACOS IMPROVEMENTS:
- Fixed "Install ffmpeg" warning by passing --ffmpeg-location to yt-dlp
- Uses ffmpeg instead of ffprobe for resolution detection (ffprobe not bundled)
- Clear explanation of CPU usage: VP9 decoding uses CPU, encoding uses Media Engine
- VideoToolbox hardware encoder confirmation in logs

 FILE HANDLING:
- Better temp file detection with multiple search strategies
- Handles yt-dlp naming variations (format IDs in filenames)
- Longer waits for file system sync to prevent race conditions
- Validates file size to ensure downloads are complete

v18.1.6 Changes - 4K RESOLUTION PRESERVATION FIX:
- FIXED: 4K videos being downscaled to 1080p during FFmpeg conversion
- NEW: FFprobe detection of actual source video resolution before encoding
- NEW: Explicit -s WIDTHxHEIGHT parameter in FFmpeg command preserves resolution
- IMPROVED: Increased default bitrates for H.264 encoding (H.264 needs higher bitrates than VP9):
  - 4K: 45 Mbps (was 15 Mbps) - matches quality of YouTube's 9.3 Mbps VP9
  - 1440p: 20 Mbps (was 10 Mbps)
  - 1080p: 8 Mbps (was 6 Mbps)
  - 720p: 5 Mbps (was 4 Mbps)
- IMPROVED: Resolution logged before encoding for verification

v18.1.5 Changes - RETRY LOGIC & FILE SYNC FIX:
- FIXED: Downloads failing on first attempt due to YouTube rate limiting
- NEW: Automatic retry logic (up to 2 retries with 3 second delays) for rate-limited downloads
- NEW: File system sync delays after downloads to prevent race conditions
- IMPROVED: More robust file detection with size validation (ensures file is not empty)
- IMPROVED: Better logging during retry attempts ("Download attempt X failed, retrying...")
- IMPROVED: Video file search now excludes _temp_audio files to avoid false matches

v18.1.4 Changes - 403 FORBIDDEN FIX:
- FIXED: 403 Forbidden errors by using multiple player clients (tv,android_sdkless)
  instead of forcing android_sdkless only
- FIXED: Audio/video file detection now uses specific file prefixes to avoid
  false "file downloaded successfully" messages
- FIXED: Corrupted emoji characters in log output (mojibake cleanup)
- IMPROVED: Format selection now prefers avc1 (H.264) codec for better QuickTime
  compatibility, matching the working manual yt-dlp command
- IMPROVED: Audio format selection prefers AAC codec (acodec^=mp4a) for compatibility
- IMPROVED: _find_temp_file and _find_chapter_temp_file properly handle audio files
- IMPROVED: Both methods now skip .part files and provide better error logging
- IMPROVED: Chapter downloads also updated with improved player client strategy
- REMOVED: --remote-components ejs:github flag (not needed with tv client)

v18.0.5 Changes - DOWNLOAD BUTTON & SELECTION FIX:
- FIXED: Download button now ALWAYS visible without needing fullscreen

  1. Enable browser cookies in Settings > Cookies
  2. Create a burner account (follow the guide!)
  3. Update yt-dlp to nightly build via Update button
  4. Close your browser completely before downloading

"Age-restricted video" error:
  Enable cookies from a browser where you're signed into YouTube.
  Use a burner account to protect your personal account.

"App is damaged" error:
  Run in Terminal: xattr -cr /Applications/YouTube\\ 4K\\ Downloader.app

App won't open:
  Right-click the app > Select "Open" > Click "Open" in dialog

Cookie errors:
  * Close the browser completely (Cmd+Q) before testing/downloading
  * Make sure you're signed into YouTube in the selected profile
  * Try a different browser (Firefox usually works best)

Playlist videos randomly fail:
  The app will automatically retry failed downloads once.
  If a video still fails, it may be age-restricted, private,
  or region-locked. Check the Activity Log for details.

YouTube Mix playlists not working:
  Mix playlists (RD prefix) are auto-generated and cannot be
  enumerated. The app will download the single seed video instead.
